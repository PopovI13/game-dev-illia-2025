<h1 align=centre>t1a02-vibe-code-cleaning-illia.html</h1>

you need to put cleaned code here. No CSS, no confusing divs and paragraphs. Just as simple
as possible webpage html. <br><br>

if doing java script are the variables sensibly named using camelCase "myVar" etc dont use
 promises (.then) instead use async/await, no addEventListeners unless necessary, get chatGPT to make
 the changes. More changes... Only simple javascript nothing fancy

 Here is the original vibecode<br>
